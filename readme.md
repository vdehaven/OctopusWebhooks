# Octopus Webhooks

Via the subscriptions listed in `EventSubscriptions.json`, respond to the configured events by deploying to the given tenants.  Notifies via email or Slack on failure.

This is a [Freya](https://docs.freya.io/en/latest/index.html) server written in F# that runs on http://localhost:8080/deploy by default.  In Octopus, use Configuration | Subscriptions to send any combination of events you prefer to the Freya server.

The structure of EventSubscriptions.json follows.  All `Name` elements are used simply to make the JSON readable.  `Id` elements are the Octopus IDs, discoverable via their API.  The included file is only an example, and will need to be configured for your use.

- `Subscriptions`: Array of events to which the server should respond, along with their deployment schemes 
    - `Events`: Array of events
        - `Category`: Category of the event coming from Octopus, i.e., "Deployment Succeeded"
